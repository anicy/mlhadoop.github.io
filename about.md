#### About Me:



I am a Computer Science student at South China University of Technological, Guangzhou.

I love Python strings as much as I love Java.

I love Github as much as I love MarkDown.

I love Machine Learning as much as I love Data Mining.

Call me an *artist*, not a coder.


You can find the list of [projects](http://dcycome.vicp.net/projects) I did in my free time, including some programming work on Github.


Any interest, please contact me at [dcycome@gmail.com](dcycome@gmail.com)
